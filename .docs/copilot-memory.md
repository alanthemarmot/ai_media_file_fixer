# Copilot Memory - Media File Renamer

## Current Task
✅ COMPLETED: Implemented API key management - check for server-side .env API key first, only prompt user if missing.

## API Key Management Implementation
- Backend now checks for TMDB_API_KEY in .env file first
- If server has API key: users don't need to provide one
- If server doesn't have API key: users are prompted to enter one in frontend
- Added new `/api/server-key-status` endpoint to check server key status
- Frontend checks server key status on app load before prompting user

## Changes Made:
1. **Backend config.py**: Made TMDB_API_KEY optional, added has_server_api_key() function
2. **Backend routes.py**: Added server-key-status endpoint, improved error handling for missing API keys
3. **Frontend apiKeyService.ts**: Added checkServerApiKey() function  
4. **Frontend api.ts**: Added checkServerApiKeyStatus() function and better error handling
5. **Frontend App.tsx**: Updated to check server API key status before prompting user
6. **start.sh**: Updated to use `uv run` instead of direct uvicorn command

## Testing Results ✅
- Server with API key: ✅ Works without user input
- Server without API key + user provides key: ✅ Works with user's key  
- No API key anywhere: ✅ Returns proper error message
- API endpoints tested with curl using uv environment: ✅ All working correctly

## User Experience
- If .env file exists with TMDB_API_KEY: App works immediately without prompting user
- If no .env file: App prompts user to enter API key in frontend
- Seamless fallback from server key to user key

## Current Task
✅ COMPLETED: Updated API cog wheel icon to have blue background with white icon

## UI Color Scheme Applied
- Primary buttons: `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600`
- Secondary buttons: `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700`
- Input focus: `focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500`
- Updated API cog icon to `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600` with white icon (`text-white`)

## Changes Made:
1. **App.tsx**: ✅ Updated cog wheel button to have blue background (`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600`) with white icon (`text-white`)
2. **ApiKeySetup.tsx**: ✅ Added `focus:border-blue-500` to input styling for consistency
3. **SettingsModal.tsx**: ✅ Added `focus:ring-2`, `focus:border-blue-500`, and `bg-white` to input styling for consistency and white background

## Project Structure
- Frontend: React/TypeScript with Vite
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- Components include: DisplayArea, ResultsList, EpisodeList, SeasonList
- Images stored in: frontend/public/ and frontend/images/
- Available no-image assets: no-image.svg

## Issue Investigation
FOUND: The "no image" fallback is missing in several components:

1. **ResultsList.tsx** - Line 31: Only shows img if poster_path exists, no fallback
2. **EpisodeList.tsx** - Lines 58-67: Only shows img if moviePosterPath/poster_path exists, no fallback  
3. **SeasonList.tsx** - Lines 119-123: ✅ GOOD - Has proper fallback with gray placeholder

## Fix Applied ✅
FIXED: Added "no image" fallback placeholders to components:

1. **ResultsList.tsx** - ✅ Added conditional rendering with gray placeholder div when poster_path is missing
2. **EpisodeList.tsx** - ✅ Updated nested conditional logic to show gray placeholder when both moviePosterPath and selectedSeason.poster_path are missing
3. **SeasonList.tsx** - ✅ Already had proper fallback (no changes needed)

## Changes Made
- Used consistent gray placeholder styling: `bg-gray-200 rounded shadow flex items-center justify-center text-gray-400 text-xs`
- Ensured proper dimensions match original image containers
- Added "No Image" text within placeholders for clarity
