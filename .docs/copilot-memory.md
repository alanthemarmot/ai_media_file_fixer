# Copilot Memory - Media File Renamer

## Current Task
âœ… COMPLETED: Set default minimum width for the app to prevent cramped layout

### Issue Fixed:
- App content was appearing very narrow on wider screens
- Search input box text looked cut off due to cramped layout
- Home page content was too small and difficult to use

### Changes Made:
1. **App.tsx**:
   - Added `min-w-[800px]` to outer container to ensure minimum 800px width
   - Changed inner content from `max-w-6xl` to `max-w-5xl` with `min-w-[700px]`
   - This provides better responsive behavior across different screen sizes

### Results:
- âœ… App now maintains readable width on all screen sizes
- âœ… Search input no longer appears cramped
- âœ… Content stays consistently sized and easy to use
- âœ… Better user experience across desktop and tablet sizes

### Previous Task:
âœ… COMPLETED: Enhanced filmography categorization and breadcrumb navigation

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Enhanced Filmography Component**:
- âœ… Completely rewrote `Filmography.tsx` with intelligent categorization based on person type
- âœ… **Actor categories**: Films, TV Shows, Other (crew work, documentaries, appearances)
- âœ… **Director/Crew categories**: Directed, Produced, Other (acting work, other departments)
- âœ… Added tabbed interface for better organization
- âœ… Dynamic tab creation based on available content
- âœ… Improved visual consistency with the rest of the app

#### 2. **Enhanced Breadcrumb Navigation**:
- âœ… Added `personContext` state to track person when navigating from filmography
- âœ… Updated breadcrumbs to include person name when viewing items from their filmography
- âœ… Clicking person name in breadcrumbs returns to their filmography
- âœ… Updated reset functions to clear person context appropriately
- âœ… Added person context handling in `handleFilmographyItemSelect()`

#### 3. **Smart Navigation Logic**:
- âœ… When selecting item from filmography: person context is preserved
- âœ… When selecting person directly: person context is cleared
- âœ… Breadcrumb shows: Home â†’ Search Results â†’ [Person Name] â†’ [Movie/TV Show]
- âœ… User can navigate back to person without re-searching

### User Experience Improvements:
- **Better Organization**: Content categorized meaningfully by person type
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Always know where you are and how to get back
- **Faster Workflow**: No need to re-search for people when exploring their work
- **Professional Interface**: Clean tabbed layout matches app design

### Technical Implementation:

- Preserved all existing functionality while adding new features
- State management for person context tracking
- Async breadcrumb navigation with proper loading states

### Changes Made:
1. **README.md Updates**:
   - âœ… Updated main description to mention people (actors/directors) search
   - âœ… Added new features: Universal Search, Multi-Tab Results, Person Filmography, Smart Navigation
   - âœ… Updated "How It Works" section to include person search workflow
   - âœ… Enhanced project structure to show key new components

   - âœ… Updated HTML page title from "Media File Renamer" to "Media File Renamer - Search Movies, TV Shows & People"

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - âœ… Home page now accurately reflects the comprehensive search capabilities
   - âœ… Users will understand they can search for people, not just media content
   - âœ… Documentation is complete and accurate for the current feature set

## Previous Task
âœ… COMPLETED: Removed extra text from TV series quality format section in EpisodeList.tsx

### Issue Fixed:
- In the EpisodeList.tsx component, extra text was appearing in the quality format selection section
- The text "All episode filenames will update automatically" and directory info was cluttering the interface
- This text was on lines 127-131 and was unnecessary for the user experience

### Changes Made:
1. **EpisodeList.tsx**:
   - Removed the entire section containing "All episode filenames will update automatically"
   - Removed the directory information display from the quality format section
   - Cleaned up the quality format section to show only the radio buttons for quality selection

### Results:
- âœ… Quality format section now displays cleanly with just the quality radio buttons
- âœ… Removed redundant text that was cluttering the interface
- âœ… Cleaner, more focused user interface for episode quality selection

### Previous Task:
âœ… COMPLETED: Added title and year display to TV series views to match movie display format

### Changes Made:
1. **SeasonList.tsx**:
   - Added `seriesYear?: number` to props interface
   - Added "Media Details" section showing Title, Year, and Network
   - Positioned between "Select a Season" header and quality selector
   - Uses same styling as movie Media Details section (bg-gray-50, etc.)

2. **EpisodeList.tsx**:
   - Added `seriesYear?: number` to props interface  
   - Updated header to show title with year in brackets: "Title [Year] - Season X"
   - âœ… REMOVED Media Details section per user request - only shows in header now

3. **App.tsx**:
   - Updated SeasonList component call to pass `seriesYear={selectedItem.year}`
   - Updated EpisodeList component call to pass `seriesYear={selectedItem.year}`

### Results:
- âœ… Season selection page: Shows Media Details section with Title, Year, Network
- âœ… Episode list page: Shows title and year in header only, no Media Details section
- âœ… Maintains existing functionality for quality selection and network display

## Previous TasksMedia File Renamer

## Current Task
Adding title and year display to TV series views to match movie display format

Need to modify:
1. **SeasonList.tsx**: Add "Media Details" section showing title and year like movies do
2. **EpisodeList.tsx**: Add series title and year display similar to movies

The TV series should show:
- Title: [Series Name]  
- Year: [Year]
- Select quality format section (already exists)

This should match the movie display format shown in DisplayArea.tsx which has:
- Title and year in header
- Media Details section with Title: and Year: fields

## API Key Management Implementation
- Backend now checks for TMDB_API_KEY in .env file first
- If server has API key: users don't need to provide one
- If server doesn't have API key: users are prompted to enter one in frontend
- Added new `/api/server-key-status` endpoint to check server key status
- Frontend checks server key status on app load before prompting user

## Changes Made:
1. **Backend config.py**: Made TMDB_API_KEY optional, added has_server_api_key() function
2. **Backend routes.py**: Added server-key-status endpoint, improved error handling for missing API keys
3. **Frontend apiKeyService.ts**: Added checkServerApiKey() function  
4. **Frontend api.ts**: Added checkServerApiKeyStatus() function and better error handling
5. **Frontend App.tsx**: Updated to check server API key status before prompting user
6. **start.sh**: Updated to use `uv run` instead of direct uvicorn command

## Testing Results âœ…
- Server with API key: âœ… Works without user input
- Server without API key + user provides key: âœ… Works with user's key  
- No API key anywhere: âœ… Returns proper error message
- API endpoints tested with curl using uv environment: âœ… All working correctly

## User Experience
- If .env file exists with TMDB_API_KEY: App works immediately without prompting user
- If no .env file: App prompts user to enter API key in frontend
- Seamless fallback from server key to user key

## Current Task
âœ… COMPLETED: Updated API cog wheel icon to have blue background with white icon

## UI Color Scheme Applied
- Primary buttons: `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600`
- Secondary buttons: `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700`
- Input focus: `focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500`
- Updated API cog icon to `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600` with white icon (`text-white`)

## Changes Made:
1. **App.tsx**: âœ… Updated cog wheel button to have blue background (`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600`) with white icon (`text-white`)
2. **ApiKeySetup.tsx**: âœ… Added `focus:border-blue-500` to input styling for consistency
3. **SettingsModal.tsx**: âœ… Added `focus:ring-2`, `focus:border-blue-500`, and `bg-white` to input styling for consistency and white background

## Project Structure
- Frontend: React/TypeScript with Vite
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- Components include: DisplayArea, ResultsList, EpisodeList, SeasonList
- Images stored in: frontend/public/ and frontend/images/
- Available no-image assets: no-image.svg

## Issue Investigation
FOUND: The "no image" fallback is missing in several components:

1. **ResultsList.tsx** - Line 31: Only shows img if poster_path exists, no fallback
2. **EpisodeList.tsx** - Lines 58-67: Only shows img if moviePosterPath/poster_path exists, no fallback  
3. **SeasonList.tsx** - Lines 119-123: âœ… GOOD - Has proper fallback with gray placeholder

## Fix Applied âœ…
FIXED: Added "no image" fallback placeholders to components:

1. **ResultsList.tsx** - âœ… Added conditional rendering with gray placeholder div when poster_path is missing
2. **EpisodeList.tsx** - âœ… Updated nested conditional logic to show gray placeholder when both moviePosterPath and selectedSeason.poster_path are missing
3. **SeasonList.tsx** - âœ… Already had proper fallback (no changes needed)

## Changes Made
- Used consistent gray placeholder styling: `bg-gray-200 rounded shadow flex items-center justify-center text-gray-400 text-xs`
- Ensured proper dimensions match original image containers
- Added "No Image" text within placeholders for clarity
