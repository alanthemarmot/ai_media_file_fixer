# Copilot Memory - Media File Renamer

## Current Task
✅ COMPLETED: Centered cast display and increased cast limit from 8 to 15 actors

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Cast Not Centered**: Cast buttons were left-aligned instead of centered like directors/composers
2. **Limited Cast Display**: TV shows and movies only showed 8 actors maximum when there are often more main cast members

### Changes Made:

1. **Frontend (DisplayArea.tsx)**: ✅ Centered cast display
   - Added `justify-center` class to both cast sections (TV show and movie)
   - Now matches the centered layout of directors and composers
   - Applied to both: `<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 mt-1 justify-center">`

2. **Backend (tmdb.py)**: ✅ Increased cast limit 
   - Changed cast limit from 8 to 15 actors for both movies and TV shows
   - Updated both sections: `for actor in credits_data.get("cast", [])[:15]:`
   - Now shows up to 15 main cast members instead of just 8

### Implementation Details:
- **Consistent Styling**: Cast now has same centered layout as other clickable elements
- **Better Representation**: Shows more of the main cast for better context
- **User Experience**: Users can see and interact with more cast members
- **Performance**: Still limited to prevent excessive UI clutter

### User Experience Improvements:
- **Visual Consistency**: All clickable person elements (cast, directors, composers) now have centered alignment
- **More Complete Cast**: Users can see up to 15 actors instead of being limited to 8
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, centered presentation matches the app's design standards

## Previous Task

  - Each person is a clickable button with same styling as cast members
  - Handles pluralization (Director vs Directors, Composer vs Composers)
  - Uses same blue button styling with hover effects as cast

### Changes Made:
1. **Backend (tmdb.py)**:
   - Directors/Composers: Return `{id, name, profile_path}` objects instead of strings
   - Both movie and TV show sections updated
   - Maintains same job filtering logic

2. **Frontend (api.ts)**:

- **CORS**: ✅ Preflight OPTIONS requests succeeding 
- **Server Logs**: ✅ Showing successful `GET /api/search?query=test HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`
- **API Key**: ✅ Backend configured with server API key, no frontend key needed
- **Data Format**: ✅ Directors/composers correctly returned as strings

### Current Status:
- **Backend**: ✅ Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- **Frontend**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:5174  
- **API Communication**: ✅ Working (verified in server logs)
- **Directors/Composers**: ✅ Displaying as single-line text

### User Action Required:
Refresh the frontend page (http://localhost:5174) - the search should now work correctly.

## Previous Task
✅ COMPLETED: Format directors and composers as single-line comma-separated strings

- **Error Resolution**: ✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors

### Changes Made:
1. **Backend (tmdb.py)**:
   - Directors: `directors.append(person["name"])` → `", ".join(directors)`
   - Composers: `composers.append(person["name"])` → `", ".join(composers)`
   - Returns: `string | None` instead of `CrewMember[]`

2. **Frontend (api.ts)**:
   - Updated CrewInfo interface: `directors?: string, composers?: string`

3. **Frontend (DisplayArea.tsx)**:
   - Removed `.map()` loops and button clicking for directors/composers
   - Added simple text display with comma detection for plural forms
   - Applied to both TV show and movie sections

### Final Result:
Directors and composers now display as clean, single-line text instead of multiple clickable buttons. The format automatically detects plurals using comma presence (e.g., "Directors: Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan").

### User Experience:
- **Cleaner UI**: No more button clutter for directors/composers
- **Consistent Data**: Both movies and TV shows display uniformly

## Previous TasksMedia File Renamer

## Current Task
Adding title and year display to TV series views to match movie display format

Need to modify:
1. **SeasonList.tsx**: Add "Media Details" section showing title and year like movies do
2. **EpisodeList.tsx**: Add series title and year display similar to movies

The TV series should show:
- Title: [Series Name]  
- Year: [Year]
- Select quality format section (already exists)

This should match the movie display format shown in DisplayArea.tsx which has:
- Title and year in header
- Media Details section with Title: and Year: fields

## API Key Management Implementation
- Backend now checks for TMDB_API_KEY in .env file first
- If server has API key: users don't need to provide one
- If server doesn't have API key: users are prompted to enter one in frontend
- Added new `/api/server-key-status` endpoint to check server key status
- Frontend checks server key status on app load before prompting user

## Changes Made:
1. **Backend config.py**: Made TMDB_API_KEY optional, added has_server_api_key() function
2. **Backend routes.py**: Added server-key-status endpoint, improved error handling for missing API keys
3. **Frontend apiKeyService.ts**: Added checkServerApiKey() function  
4. **Frontend api.ts**: Added checkServerApiKeyStatus() function and better error handling
5. **Frontend App.tsx**: Updated to check server API key status before prompting user
6. **start.sh**: Updated to use `uv run` instead of direct uvicorn command

## Testing Results ✅
- Server with API key: ✅ Works without user input
- Server without API key + user provides key: ✅ Works with user's key  
- No API key anywhere: ✅ Returns proper error message
- API endpoints tested with curl using uv environment: ✅ All working correctly

## User Experience
- If .env file exists with TMDB_API_KEY: App works immediately without prompting user
- If no .env file: App prompts user to enter API key in frontend
- Seamless fallback from server key to user key

## Current Task
✅ COMPLETED: Updated API cog wheel icon to have blue background with white icon

## UI Color Scheme Applied
- Primary buttons: `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600`
- Secondary buttons: `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700`
- Input focus: `focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500`
- Updated API cog icon to `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600` with white icon (`text-white`)

## Changes Made:
1. **App.tsx**: ✅ Updated cog wheel button to have blue background (`bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600`) with white icon (`text-white`)
2. **ApiKeySetup.tsx**: ✅ Added `focus:border-blue-500` to input styling for consistency
3. **SettingsModal.tsx**: ✅ Added `focus:ring-2`, `focus:border-blue-500`, and `bg-white` to input styling for consistency and white background

## Project Structure
- Frontend: React/TypeScript with Vite
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- Components include: DisplayArea, ResultsList, EpisodeList, SeasonList
- Images stored in: frontend/public/ and frontend/images/
- Available no-image assets: no-image.svg

## Issue Investigation
FOUND: The "no image" fallback is missing in several components:

1. **ResultsList.tsx** - Line 31: Only shows img if poster_path exists, no fallback
2. **EpisodeList.tsx** - Lines 58-67: Only shows img if moviePosterPath/poster_path exists, no fallback  
3. **SeasonList.tsx** - Lines 119-123: ✅ GOOD - Has proper fallback with gray placeholder

## Fix Applied ✅
FIXED: Added "no image" fallback placeholders to components:

1. **ResultsList.tsx** - ✅ Added conditional rendering with gray placeholder div when poster_path is missing
2. **EpisodeList.tsx** - ✅ Updated nested conditional logic to show gray placeholder when both moviePosterPath and selectedSeason.poster_path are missing
3. **SeasonList.tsx** - ✅ Already had proper fallback (no changes needed)

## Changes Made
- Used consistent gray placeholder styling: `bg-gray-200 rounded shadow flex items-center justify-center text-gray-400 text-xs`
- Ensured proper dimensions match original image containers
- Added "No Image" text within placeholders for clarity

## Current Task (COMPLETED)
✅ COMPLETED: Fixed composer display in person results and filmography

### Issue Resolved:
1. **Person Results Display**: Was showing "Sound" for composers instead of "Composer"
2. **Filmography Categorization**: Composers now have specialized categories:
   - **Composer**: Shows their composition work (Sound department)
   - **Other**: Shows their film/TV appearances, acting work, other departments

### Changes Made:

1. **PersonResultsList.tsx**: ✅ Fixed department display
   - Added conditional logic: `{result.known_for_department === 'Sound' ? 'Composer' : result.known_for_department}`
   - Now displays "Composer" instead of "Sound" for music composers

2. **Filmography.tsx**: ✅ Enhanced composer support
   - Added `isComposer` detection: `filmography.person.known_for_department === 'Sound'`
   - Added composer-specific categorization logic:
     - **Primary tab**: "Composer" - filters Sound department and jobs containing "composer"
     - **Secondary tab**: "Other" - shows acting work and non-composer crew work
   - Updated person info header to display "Composer" instead of "Sound"
   - Fixed availableTabs array to handle null secondary category

3. **Type Safety**: ✅ Fixed TypeScript issues
   - Updated availableTabs creation to conditionally include secondary tab only when it exists
   - Prevents runtime errors when secondary category is null

### Implementation Details:
- **Composer Detection**: Uses `known_for_department === 'Sound'` from TMDB API
- **Categorization Logic**: Filters by Sound department and job titles containing "composer"
- **Consistent UI**: Same styling and interaction patterns as other person types
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles cases where composers have minimal data

### User Experience Improvements:
- **Clear Identification**: Composers now clearly labeled as "Composer" not "Sound"
- **Organized Filmography**: Composition work separated from other appearances
- **Professional Display**: Matches user expectations for how composers should be categorized
- **Consistent Interface**: Same visual design as actors and directors

### Testing:
- ✅ Application starts successfully on http://localhost:5174/
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Ready for testing with composers like Bear McCreary

## Previous Task (COMPLETED)
✅ COMPLETED: Added cast, director, and composer information to TV show season selection page
